## Decription
A Python program that creates HTML to display info on an array of movies.

## Contents

* entertainment_center.py - Main file
* fresh_tomatoes.py - Creates HTML
* media.py - Contains Movie class

## Quick Start
All you need to run this program is Python 2.x.

* First, fork and clone this repository.
* Then feel free to modify the displayed movie content in entertainment_center.py.
* Now run `python entertainment_center.py`
* The output of the program will launch in a new tab on your default browser, enjoy!

## Additional Feature
In addition to the baseline requirements of this project, I've modified fresh_tomatoes.py to display storyline information.
